# Adafruit fork of the Arduino NINA-W102 firmware

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/nina-fw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/nina-fw)

This is the Adafruit fork of the Arduino NINA-W102 firmware. The original
repository is located at https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw

This firmware uses [Espressif's IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

The NINA firmware version needs to be updated in four places in this repo:
1. CommandHandler.cpp
1. combine.py
1. CHANGELOG

## Building

These instructions may differ from the instructions included in the
original Arduino firmware repository.

1. [Download the ESP32 toolchain](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
1. Extract it and add it to your `PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/toolchain>/bin`
1. Clone **v4.4.5** of the IDF: `git clone --branch v4.4.5 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
1. In the IDF folder, run `./install.sh`, then `. ./export.sh`
1. Run `idf.py build` to build the binary (in the directory of this read me)
1. Run `python combine.py` to create a binary that can be burned at 0x0000
1. You should have a file named `NINA_W102-x.x.x.bin` in the top directory
1. Use appropriate tools (esptool.py, appropriate pass-through firmware etc)
   to load this binary file onto your board.
    a. If you do not know how to do this, [there is an excellent guide on the Adafruit Learning System for upgrading your ESP32's firmware](https://learn.adafruit.com/upgrading-esp32-firmware)
